2.introduction 
2.1Problems
The Idea comes from that there isn’t a specialized Social platform for  Food in general that they could interact and share experiences and meet Professionals in the industry of food ,and of course the machine learning approach make it so simple for them to find the meals they would like to cook ,with the whole instructions and recipes which make it  Free and available all the time, more over Rating of recipes as more people liked them make it easier for them to find the most Popular recipe to cook ,and in the last Students that didn’t have any resources to know how they cook could find all Kinds of recipes and the instructions all in one from  in our Platform  , and there is no website that can offer a feature that search a recipe  by its ingredients


2.2 objectives
This research aims to design a platform that Help users to search for recipes by providing the recommender system with the ingredients of  the wanted recipe 
This  Platform  comes with many features for the user, which the users can provide the recommender system the ingredient of the wanting recipe then it will return the mostly matched recipes that have the ingredient that the user provided. Moreover, the users could interact, share, follow and rate the recipes that the other users shares in the platform.
Each user has an account that he could brows all the content in the websites ,first he goes to explore page then he could follow the content he likes more ,and his account id secured and verified account by email ,and the users could reset there password in case they forget it, moreover the could edit there Data ,or posting The Recipes they made ,providing as with Data we need in the Recommender system , and manipulate these data in a recommender system to provide them with the wanting recipes in the Backend 



2.3 Scope 
The Product we come up with is Software +research backend Recommender system ,the website build mainly in (Django Python in the backend ,Postgres SQL as Database and it Uses  MVT (Model ,View ,Template ) architecture, and the Front end built with HTML5 ,CSS3 ,JS,Bootstrab ,JQury ,and some  libraries of JS ,  Vanilla JavaScript and Tailwind CSS  , we began with design the database and Writing our APIs ,and we  used  Flutter for the mobile part to chatting between users,In the End we Uses the distributed version control and source code management functionality Git /Github in team work
 we used Scrumban which is an Agile development methodology that is a hybrid of Scrum and Kanban ,and organizing our work and tasks to be done and completed in Trello

2.4 importance
There is no social media platform that specialize in food industry and recipe sharing ,and data collecting to benefit other users from the search Engine ,so our website provide and easy and reliable way to let users in general and students in particular to search there recipes using the Search engine(recommender system ) by ingredients ,  as we mentioned previously this platform aimed to help students who are far from there families, wives ,husbands and any other single  person in  saving time  by using the search engine of ingredients and money  by providing the search engine with the available ingredients of  recipes ,and of course have fun and spend some time learning and trying new recipes for beginners ,and share knowledge and experience of Professional users and amateurs
